# Recyclink

Recyclinks is a comprehensive recycling web app to encourage and facilitate recycling in Singapore via a three-pronged approach that addresses the convenience and culture of recycling in Singapore.

## Problem Statement

Problem statement: In 2021, the National Environment Agency lamented that Singapore’s recycling rate had fallen to a 10 year low. What can we do to encourage more people to recycle, or make recycling more convenient and accessible?

## Aim

Our hack is a web application with features that come together to build on and revitalize the recycling culture in Singapore. The low recycling rate in Singapore can be attributed to a lack of public awareness of what can be recycled, as well as the entire landscape of recycling in Singapore. Our hack attempts to solve this problem via a three-pronged approach, (1) educating the public on what can be recycled and how to recycle, and (2) addressing the “convenience” aspect as well as (3) changing the culture of recycling in Singapore.
